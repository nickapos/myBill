myBill is a money flow tracking utility, it can also be used to keep track of
the receipts issued by the various shops and the utility companies (telephone,
power etc) and present them later in useful reports. It features import and
export data operations from csv format, so you can backup your database in a
platform independent format.

MyBill has been translated by the open source community members so far in six
languages. English, Greek, Spanish, Swedish, Czech, Sinhalese. If you would like to help translate it in more languages please any help is appreciated.
The translation effort of the project is hosted by launchpad:
